This build.xml file will let you create the EMS file.

The following are the steps required to create a build.

1. Copy the files for iserver (not encrypted), rsmagent and ff rsmlite into the directory files/software
2. Run 'ant -Dvers=5.1d8 dist' (use the correct version #)
   This will create the distribution file. Unfortunately for this release the generics will not be updated. 
3. Update generics.xml with the correct version numbers for each component and the top level (ems) version number.
   Update the file sizes in generics.xml. The compressed size is taken from software.tar.gz. FF used a factor of 3 to
   determine uncompressed sizes (I assume that this was only an estimate).
4. Run  'ant -Dvers=5.1d8 dist' (use the correct version #) again. This will create the ems tar file in the releases
   directory releases/i686pc-ems-5.1d8-11292007
