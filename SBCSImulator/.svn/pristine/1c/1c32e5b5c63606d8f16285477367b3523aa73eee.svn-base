  $Date: 2002/10/17 21:16:16 $</PRE>
<P>This document is a minimal draft which is in need of further work.</P>
<P>The changes will occur both because the DBI specification is changing
and hence the requirements on DBD drivers change, and because feedback
from people reading this document will suggest improvements to it.</P>
<P>Please read the DBI documentation first and fully, including the DBI FAQ.
The reread the DBI specification again as you're reading this. It'll help.</P>
<P>This document is a patchwork of contributions from various authors.
More contributions (preferably as patches) are very welcome.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>This document is primarily intended to help people writing new
database drivers for the Perl Database Interface (Perl DBI).
It may also help others interested in discovering why the internals of
a DBD driver are written the way they are.</P>
<P>This is a guide.  Few (if any) of the statements in it are completely
authoritative under all possible circumstances.  This means you will
need to use judgement in applying the guidelines in this document.
If in <EM>any</EM> doubt at all, please do contact the dbi-dev mailing list
(details given below) where Tim Bunce and other driver authors can help.</P>
<P>The primary web-site for locating DBI software and information is</P>
<PRE>
  <A HREF="http://dbi.perl.org/">http://dbi.perl.org/</A></PRE>
<P>There are 2 main and one auxilliary mailing lists for people working
with DBI.  The primary lists are <A HREF="mailto:dbi-users@isc.org">dbi-users@isc.org</A> for general users
of DBI and DBD drivers, and <A HREF="mailto:dbi-dev@isc.org">dbi-dev@isc.org</A> mainly for DBD driver
writers (don't join the dbi-dev list unless you have a good reason).
The auxilliary list is <A HREF="mailto:dbi-announce@isc.org">dbi-announce@isc.org</A> for announcing new
releases of DBI or DBD drivers.</P>
<P>You can join these lists by accessing the web-site

The lists are closed so you cannot send email to any of the lists
unless you join the list first.</P>
<P>You should also consider monitoring the comp.lang.perl.* newsgroups.</P>

<P>The definitive book on Perl DBI is 'Programming the Perl DBI: Database
programming with Perl' by Alligator Descartes and Tim Bunce, published

<H1><A NAME="registering a new driver">REGISTERING A NEW DRIVER</A></H1>
<P>Before writing a new driver, it is in your interests to find out
whether there already is a driver for your database.  If there is such
a driver, it would be much easier to make use of it than to write your
own!</P>
<P>

<P>The primary web-site for locating Perl software is
<A HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN">http://www.perl.com/CPAN</A>.
You should look under the various modules listings for the software
you are after.
Two of the main pages you should look at are:</P>

<P>See the DBI docs for information on DBI web sites and mailing lists.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="registering a new driver">Registering a new driver</A></H2>
<P>Before going through any official registration process, you will need
to establish that there is no driver already in the works.
You'll do that by asking the DBI mailing lists whether there is such a
driver available, or whether anybody is working on one.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="creating a new driver using pure perl">CREATING A NEW DRIVER USING PURE PERL</A></H1>
<P>Writing a pure Perl driver is surprisingly simple. However, there are
some problems one should be aware of. The best option is of course
picking up an existing driver and carefully modifying one method
after the other.</P>
<P>As an example we take a look at the <EM>DBD::File</EM> driver, a driver for
accessing plain files as tables, which is part of the <EM>DBD::CSV</EM>
package. In what follows I assume the name <CODE>Driver</CODE> for your new
package: The least thing we have to implement are the files
<A HREF="#item_Makefile%2EPL"><CODE>Makefile.PL</CODE></A> and <A HREF="#item_Driver%2Epm"><CODE>Driver.pm</CODE></A>.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="makefile.pl">Makefile.PL</A></H2>
<P>You typically start with writing <A HREF="#item_Makefile%2EPL"><CODE>Makefile.PL</CODE></A>, a Makefile generator.
The contents of this file are described in detail in the MakeMaker
man pages, it's definitely a good idea if you start reading them.
At least you should know about the variables <EM>CONFIGURE</EM>, <EM>DEFINED</EM>,
<EM>DIR</EM>, <EM>EXE_FILES</EM>, <EM>INC</EM>, <EM>LIBS</EM>, <EM>LINKTYPE</EM>, <EM>NAME</EM>, <EM>OPTIMIZE</EM>,
<EM>PL_FILES</EM>, <EM>VERSION</EM>, <EM>VERSION_FROM</EM>, <EM>clean</EM>, <EM>depend</EM>, <EM>realclean</EM>
from the <CODE>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</CODE> man page: These are used in almost any
Makefile.PL. Additionally read the section on <EM>Overriding MakeMaker Methods</EM>
and the descriptions of the <EM>distcheck</EM>, <EM>disttest</EM> and <EM>dist</EM> targets:
They will definitely be useful for you.</P>
<P>Of special importance for DBI drivers is the <EM>postamble</EM> method from
the <CODE>ExtUtils::MM_Unix</CODE> man page. And for Emacs users I recommend
the <EM>libscan</EM> method.</P>
<P>Now an example, I use the word <CODE>Driver</CODE> wherever you should insert
your drivers name:</P>
<PRE>
  # -*- perl -*-</PRE>
<PRE>
  use DBI 1.03;
  use DBI::DBD;
  use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;</PRE>
<PRE>
  WriteMakefile(
      dbd_edit_mm_attribs( {
          'NAME'         =&gt; 'DBD::Driver',
          'VERSION_FROM' =&gt; 'Driver.pm',
          'INC'          =&gt; $DBI_INC_DIR,
          'dist'         =&gt; { 'SUFFIX'   =&gt; '.gz',
                                'COMPRESS' =&gt; 'gzip -9f' },
          'realclean'    =&gt; '*.xsi'
      } )
  );</PRE>
<PRE>
  package MY;
  sub postamble { return main::dbd_postamble(@_); }
  sub libscan {
      my ($self, $path) = @_;
      ($path =~ m/\~$/) ? undef : $path;
  }</PRE>
<P>Note the calls to <CODE>dbd_edit_mm_attribs()</CODE> and dbd_postamble().</P>
<P>See also <A HREF="..\..\..\site\lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker(3).html">the ExtUtils::MakeMaker(3) manpage</A>. <A HREF="..\..\..\site\lib/ExtUtils/MM_Unix(3).html">the ExtUtils::MM_Unix(3) manpage</A>.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="readme file">README file</A></H2>
<P>The README file should describe what the driver is for, the
pre-requisites for the build process, the actual build process, and how
to report errors. Users will find ways of breaking the driver build and
test process which you would never even dreamed to be possible in your
nightmares. :-) Therefore, you need to write this document defensively
and precisely.  Also, it is in your interests to ensure that your tests
work as widely as possible. As always, use the README from one of the
established drivers as a basis for your own.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="manifest">MANIFEST</A></H2>
<P>The MANIFEST will be used by the Makefile'd dist target to build the
distribution tar file that is uploaded to CPAN. It should list every
file that you want to include in your distribution, one per line.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="lib/bundle/dbd/driver.pm">lib/Bundle/DBD/Driver.pm</A></H2>
<P>The CPAN module provides an extremely powerful bundle mechanism that
allows you to specify pre-requisites for your driver.
The primary pre-requisite is Bundle::DBI; you may want or need to add
some more.
With the bundle set up correctly, the user can type:</P>
<PRE>
        perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::DBD::Driver'</PRE>
<P>and Perl will download, compile, test and install all the Perl modules
needed to build your driver.</P>
<P>A suitable skeleton for this file is shown below.
The prerequisite modules are listed in the CONTENTS section, with the
official name of the module followed by a dash and an informal name or
description.
Listing Bundle::DBI as the main pre-requisite simplifies life.
Don't forget to list your driver.
Note that unless the DBMS is itself a Perl module, you cannot list it
as a pre-requisite in this file.
You are strongly advised to keep the version of the bundle in sync
with the version of your driver.
You might want to add configuration management, copyright, and
licencing information at the top.</P>

  If you've not previously used the CPAN module to install any
  bundles, you will be interrogated during its setup phase.
  But when you've done it once, it remembers what you told it.
  You could start by running:</PRE>

  This bundle was created by ripping off Bundle::libnet created by
  Graham Barr E&lt;lt&gt;F&lt;gbarr@ti.com&gt;E&lt;gt&gt;, and radically simplified
  with some information from Jochen Wiedmann E&lt;lt&gt;F&lt;joe@ispsoft.de&gt;E&lt;gt&gt;.
  The template was then included in the DBI::DBD documentation by
  Jonathan Leffler E&lt;lt&gt;F&lt;jleffler@informix.com&gt;E&lt;gt&gt;.</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="driver.pm">Driver.pm</A></H2>
<P>The Driver.pm file defines the Perl module DBD::Driver for your driver.
It will define a package DBD::Driver along with some version information,
some variable definitions, and a function <CODE>driver()</CODE> which will have a more
or less standard structure.</P>
<P>It will also define a package DBD::Driver::dr (with methods connect(),
<CODE>data_sources()</CODE> and disconnect_all()), and a package DBD::Driver::db
(which will define a function <CODE>prepare()</CODE> etc), and a package DBD::Driver::st
with methods execute(), <CODE>fetch()</CODE> and the like.</P>
<P>The Driver.pm file will also contain the documentation specific to
DBD::Driver in the format used by perldoc.</P>
<P>Now let's take a closer look at an excerpt of File.pm as an example.
We ignore things that are common to any module (even non-DBI(D) modules)
or really specific for the DBD::File package.</P>

  $sqlstate = &quot;&quot;;       # holds SQL state for    DBI::state</PRE>
<P>These variables are used for storing error states and messages.
However, it is crucial to understand that you must not modify
them directly; instead use the <EM>event</EM> method, see below.</P>
<PRE>
  $drh = undef;         # holds driver handle once initialized</PRE>
<P>This is where the driver handle will be stored, once created. Note,
that you may assume, there's only one handle for your driver.</P>

<PRE>
      return $drh;
  }</PRE>
<P>The <EM>driver</EM> method is the driver handle constructor. It's a
reasonable example of how DBI implements its handles. There are three
kinds: <STRONG>driver handles</STRONG> (typically stored in <CODE>$drh</CODE>, from now on
called <CODE>drh</CODE>), <STRONG>database handles</STRONG> (from now on called <CODE>dbh</CODE> or
<CODE>$dbh</CODE>) and <STRONG>statement handles</STRONG>, (from now on called <CODE>sth</CODE> or
<CODE>$sth</CODE>).</P>
<P>The prototype of DBI::_new_drh is</P>
<PRE>
  $drh = DBI::_new_drh($class, $attr1, $attr2);</PRE>
<P>with the following arguments:</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%24class"><EM>$class</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
is typically your drivers class, e.g., ``DBD::File::dr'', passed as first
argument to the <EM>driver</EM> method.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%24attr1"><EM>$attr1</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
is a hash ref to attributes like <EM>Name</EM>, <EM>Version</EM>, <EM>Err</EM>, <EM>Errstr</EM>
<EM>State</EM> and <EM>Attributrion</EM>. These are processed and used by DBI, you
better not make any assumptions on them nor should you add private
attributes here.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%24attr2"><EM>$attr2</EM></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This is another (optional) hash ref with your private attributes. DBI
will leave them alone.
<P></P></DL>
<P>The <EM>DBI::new_drh</EM> method and the <EM>driver</EM> method
both return <CODE>undef</CODE> for failure (in which case you must look at
$DBI::err and $DBI::errstr, because you have no driver handle).</P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_The_database_handle_constructor">The database handle constructor</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The next lines of code look as follows:
<PRE>
  package DBD::Driver::dr; # ====== DRIVER ======</PRE>
<PRE>
  $DBD::Driver::dr::imp_data_size = 0;</PRE>
<P>Note that no @ISA is needed here, or for the other DBD::Driver::*
classes, because the DBI takes care of that for you when the driver is
loaded.</P>
<P>The database handle constructor is a driver method, thus we have
to change the namespace.</P>
<PRE>
  sub connect
  {
      my ($drh, $dbname, $user, $auth, $attr) = @_;</PRE>
<PRE>
      # Some database specific verifications, default settings
      # and the like following here. This should only include
      # syntax checks or similar stuff where it's legal to
      # 'die' in case of errors.</PRE>
<PRE>
      # create a 'blank' dbh (call superclass constructor)
      my $dbh = DBI::_new_dbh($drh, {
          'Name'         =&gt; $dbname,
          'USER'         =&gt; $user,
          'CURRENT_USER' =&gt; $user,
      });</PRE>
<PRE>
      # Process attributes from the DSN; we assume ODBC syntax
      # here, that is, the DSN looks like var1=val1;...;varN=valN</PRE>
<PRE>
      my $var;
      foreach $var (split(/;/, $dbname)) {
          if ($var =~ m/(.*?)=(,*)/) {
              # Not !!! $dbh-&gt;{$var} = $val;
              $dbh-&gt;STORE($var, $val);
          }
      }
      $dbh;
  }</PRE>
<P>This is mostly the same as in the <EM>driver handle constructor</EM> above.
The arguments are described in the DBI man page. See <EM>DBI(3)</EM>.
The constructor is called, returning a database handle. The constructors
prototype is</P>
<PRE>
  $dbh = DBI::_new_dbh($drh, $attr1, $attr2);</PRE>
<P>with the same arguments as in the <EM>driver handle constructor</EM>, the
exception being <A HREF="#item_%24class"><CODE>$class</CODE></A> replaced by <CODE>$drh</CODE>.</P>
<P>Note the use of the <EM>STORE</EM> method for setting the dbh attributes.
That's because within the driver code, the handle object you have is
the 'inner' handle of a tied hash, not the outer handle that the
users of your driver have.</P>
<P>Because you have the inner handle, tie magic doesn't get invoked
when you get or set values in the hash. This is often very handy for
speed when you want to get or set simple non-special driver-specific
attributes.</P>
<P>However, some attribute values, such as those handled by the DBI
like PrintError, don't actually exist in the hash and must be
read via $h-&gt;<CODE>FETCH($attrib)</CODE> and set via $h-&gt;STORE($attrib, $value).
If in any doubt, use these methods.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Error_handling">Error handling</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
It is quite likely that something fails in the connect method. With
DBD::File for example, you might catch an error when setting the
current directory to something not existant by using the f_dir
attribute.
<P>To report an error, you use the <CODE>DBI::set_err</CODE> function/method:</P>
<PRE>
  $h-&gt;DBI::set_err($errcode, $errmsg);</PRE>
<P>This will ensure that the error is recorded correctly and that
RaiseError and PrintError etc are handled correctly.  Typically you'll
always use the method instance, aka your method's first argument.</P>
<P>As set_err always returns undef your error handling code can
usually be simplified to something like this:</P>
<PRE>
  return $h-&gt;DBI::set_err($errcode, $errmsg) if ...;</PRE>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Other_driver_handle_methods">Other driver handle methods</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
may follow here. In particular you should consider a <EM>data_sources</EM>
method, and a (possibly empty) <EM>disconnect_all</EM> method. See <EM>DBI(3)</EM>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_The_statement_handle_constructor">The statement handle constructor</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
There's nothing much new in the statement handle constructor.

<P>The DBI will handle most attributes for you, in particular attributes
like <EM>RaiseError</EM> or <EM>PrintError</EM>. All you have to do handle your
driver's private attributes and any attributes, like AutoCommit, that
the DBI can't handle for you. A good example might look like this:</P>

<P>The DBI will actually store and fetch driver-specific attributes (with all

You can and should greatly simplify your task by taking a good
reference driver implementation and modifying that to match the

<P>The de facto reference driver has been the one for DBD::Oracle, written
by Tim Bunce who is also the author of the DBI package. The DBD::Oracle
module is a good example of a driver implemented around a C-level API.</P>
<P>Nowadays it it seems better to base on DBD::ODBC, another driver
maintained by Tim and Jeff Urlwin, because it offers a lot of metadata
and seems to become the guideline for the future development. (Also as
DBD::Oracle digs deeper into the Oracle 8 OCI interface it'll get even
more hairly than it is now.)</P>
<P>The DBD::Informix driver is a good reference for a driver implemented
using 'embedded SQL'. DBD::Ingres may also be worth a look.</P>

<P>This header file has two jobs:</P>
<P>First it defines data structures for your private part of the handles.</P>
<P>Second it defines macros that rename the generic names like
<EM>dbd_db_login</EM> to database specific names like <EM>ora_db_login</EM>. This
avoids name clashes and enables use of different drivers when you work
with a statically linked perl.</P>
<P>It also will have the important task of disabling XS methods that you
don't want to implement.</P>
<P>Finally, the macros will also be used to select alternate
implementations of some functions. For example, the currently defined
<A HREF="#item_dbd_db_login"><CODE>dbd_db_login</CODE></A> function is not passed the attribute hash. In future,
if a dbd_db_login6 macro is defined (for a function with 6 arguments),
it will be used instead with the attribute hash passed at the sixth
argument.</P>
<P>People liked to just pick Oracle's dbdimp.c and use the same names,
structures and types. I strongly recommend against that: At first
glance this saves time, but your implementation will be less readable.
It was just a hell when I had to separate DBI specific parts, Oracle
specific parts, mSQL specific parts and mysql specific parts in
DBD::mysql's <EM>dbdimp.h</EM> and <EM>dbdimp.c</EM>. (DBD::mysql was a port of
DBD::mSQL which was based on DBD::Oracle.) This part of the driver

driver must discard any previous reference bound to the column.  On
each execute, the driver must evaluate the references and internally
bind the values resulting from the references.  This is only applicable

<P>Each of these took an imp_xxh pointer as an argument.</P>
<P>Since then, new attributes have been added such as ChopBlanks,
RaiseError and PrintError, and these do not have the full set of
macros.
The approved method for handling these is now the four macros:</P>
<PRE>
  DBIc_is(imp, flag)
  DBIc_has(imp, flag)    an alias for DBIc_is
  DBIc_on(imp, flag)
  DBIc_off(imp, flag)</PRE>
<P>Consequently, the DBIc_XXXXX family of macros is now mostly deprecated
and new drivers should avoid using them, even though the older drivers
will probably continue to do so for quite a while yet. However...</P>
<P>There is an <EM>important exception</EM> to that. The ACTIVE and IMPSET
flags should be set via the DBIc_ACTIVE_on and DBIc_IMPSET_on macros,
and unset via the DBIc_ACTIVE_off and DBIc_IMPSET_off macros.</P>

<H2><A NAME="using dbis>get_fbav()">Using DBIS-&gt;<CODE>get_fbav()</CODE></A></H2>
<P>The $sth-&gt;<A HREF="#item_bind_col"><CODE>bind_col()</CODE></A> and $sth-&gt;<A HREF="#item_bind_columns"><CODE>bind_columns()</CODE></A> documented in the DBI
specification do not have to be implemented by the driver writer
becuase DBI takes care of the details for you.
However, the key to ensuring that bound columns work is to call the
function DBIS-&gt;<CODE>get_fbav()</CODE> in the code which fetches a row of data.
This returns an AV, and each element of the AV contains the SV which
should be set to contain the returned data.</P>
<P>The above is for C drivers only. The Perl equivalent is the
$sth-&gt;<CODE>_set_fbav($data)</CODE> method, as described in the part on Pure
Perl drivers.</P>

<H1><A NAME="subclassing dbi drivers">SUBCLASSING DBI DRIVERS</A></H1>
<P>This is definitely an open subject. It can be done, as demonstrated by
the <EM>DBD::File</EM> driver, but it is not as simple as one might think.</P>
<P>(Note that this topic is different from subclassing the DBI. For an
example of that, see the t/subclass.t file supplied with the DBI.)</P>
<P>The main problem is that the dbh's and sth's that your <EM>connect</EM> and
<EM>prepare</EM> methods return are not instances of your <EM>DBD::Driver::db</EM>
or <EM>DBD::Driver::st</EM> packages, they are not even derived from it.
Instead they are instances of the <EM>DBI::db</EM> or <EM>DBI::st</EM> classes or
a derived subclass. Thus, if you write a method <EM>mymethod</EM> and do a</P>
<PRE>
  $dbh-&gt;mymethod()</PRE>
<P>then the autoloader will search for that method in the package <EM>DBI::db</EM>.
Of course you can instead to a</P>
<PRE>
  $dbh-&gt;func('mymethod')</PRE>
<P>and that will indeed work, even if <EM>mymethod</EM> is inherited, but not
without additional work. Setting <CODE>@ISA</CODE> is not sufficient.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="overwriting methods">Overwriting methods</A></H2>
<P>The first problem is, that the <EM>connect</EM> method has no idea of
subclasses. For example, you cannot implement base class and subclass
in the same file: The <EM>install_driver</EM> method wants to do a</P>
<PRE>
  require DBD::Driver;</PRE>
<P>In particular, your subclass <STRONG>has</STRONG> to be a separate driver, from
the view of DBI, and you cannot share driver handles.</P>
<P>Of course that's not much of a problem. You should even be able
to inherit the base classes <EM>connect</EM> method. But you cannot
simply overwrite the method, unless you do something like this,
quoted from <EM>DBD::CSV</EM>:</P>
<PRE>
  sub connect ($$;$$$) {
      my ($drh, $dbname, $user, $auth, $attr) = @_;</PRE>
<PRE>
      my $this = $drh-&gt;DBD::File::dr::connect($dbname, $user, $auth, $attr);
      if (!exists($this-&gt;{csv_tables})) {
          $this-&gt;{csv_tables} = {};
      }</PRE>
<PRE>
      $this;
  }</PRE>
<P>Note that we cannot do a</P>
<PRE>
  $srh-&gt;SUPER::connect($dbname, $user, $auth, $attr);</PRE>
<P>as we would usually do in a an OO environment, because $drh is an instance
of <EM>DBI::dr</EM>. And note, that the <EM>connect</EM> method of <EM>DBD::File</EM> is
able to handle subclass attributes. See the description of Pure Perl
drivers above.</P>
<P>It is essential that you always call superclass method in the above
manner. However, that should do.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="attribute handling">Attribute handling</A></H2>
<P>Fortunately the DBI specs allow a simple, but still performant way of
handling attributes. The idea is based on the convention that any
driver uses a prefix <EM>driver_</EM> for its private methods. Thus it's
always clear whether to pass attributes to the super class or not.
For example, consider this STORE method from the <EM>DBD::CSV</EM> class:</P>
<PRE>
  sub STORE {
      my ($dbh, $attr, $val) = @_;
      if ($attr !~ /^driver_/) {
          return $dbh-&gt;DBD::File::db::STORE($attr, $val);
      }
      if ($attr eq 'driver_foo') {
      ...
  }</PRE>

<H1><A NAME="write_getinfo_pm">write_getinfo_pm</A></H1>
<P>write_getinfo_pm generates a DBD::&lt;foo&gt;::GetInfo package.</P>
<P>Usage:</P>
<PRE>
  perl -MDBI::DBD -e write_getinfo_pm dbi:ODBC:foo_db username password &gt; DBD/&lt;foo&gt;/GetInfo.pm</PRE>
<P>or</P>
<PRE>
  perl -MDBI::DBD -e 'write_getinfo_pm(&quot;dbi:ODBC:foo_db&quot;,&quot;username&quot;,&quot;password&quot;)' &gt; DBD/&lt;foo&gt;/GetInfo.pm</PRE>
<P>This method generates a DBD::&lt;foo&gt;::GetInfo package from the data source you
specified in the parameter list or in the environment variable DBI_DSN.
DBD::&lt;foo&gt;::GetInfo should help a DBD author implementing the DBI <CODE>get_info()</CODE>
method.
Because you are just creating this package, it's very unlikly that DBD::&lt;foo&gt;
already provides a good implementation for get_info(). Thus you will probable
connect via DBD::ODBC.</P>
<P>If you connect via DBD::ODBC, you should use version 0.38 or greater;</P>
<P>Please have a critical look at the data returned! ODBC driver vary dramatically
in their quality.</P>
<P>The generator assumes that most values are static and places these values
directly in the %info hash. A few examples show the use of CODE references
and the implementation via subroutines.
It's very likely that you have to write additional subroutines for values
depending on the session state or server version, e.g. SQL_DBMS_VER.</P>
<P>A possible implementation of DBD::&lt;foo&gt;::get_info() may look like:</P>
<PRE>
  sub get_info {
    my($dbh, $info_type) = @_;
    require DBD::&lt;foo&gt;::GetInfo;
    my $v = $DBD::&lt;foo&gt;::GetInfo::info{int($info_type)};
    $v = $v-&gt;($dbh) if ref $v eq 'CODE';
    return $v;
  }</PRE>
<P>Please replace &lt;foo&gt; with the name of your driver.</P>
